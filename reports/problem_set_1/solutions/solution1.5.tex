If $X$ and $Y$ were independent, we would expect
\begin{align*}
    P(X|Y) &= P(X) \\
    P(Y|X) &= P(Y).    
\end{align*}

However, they are not independent since there are cases in which
\[
P(X,Y) \neq P(X)P(Y)
\]
and, consequently, there are cases in which
\[
P(X|Y) \neq P(X)
\]
\[
P(Y|X) \neq P(Y).
\]
For example,
\[
\big[P(X=2,Y=a)=0.25\big] \neq \big[P(X=2)P(Y=a)=0.55\cdot 0.55 = 0.3025\big]
\]
\[
\big[P(X=2|Y=a)=5/11\big]\neq \big[P(X=2)=0.55\big]
\]
