The conditional probability that an individual certainly has a mutation when the test says that an individual has a mutation can be expressed in the form of Bayes' theorem as follows:
\begin{align*}
    P(Mutation = Y|Test =Y1) = \frac{P(Test = Y1|Mutation =Y)\cdot P(Mutation =Y)}{P(Test = Y1)}
\end{align*}
Where mutation in an individual is defined by Y (Yes) and N (No) and the test results for mutation by Y1 (when tested positive) and N1 (when tested negative).
