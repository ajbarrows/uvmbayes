The statement is \textbf{False}. \\

In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm you first propose a random move with probability $g_{j\xleftarrow{}i}$, and then accepting that move with probability $A_{j\xleftarrow{}i}$. If for k consecutive steps such as from $i$ to $i+k$ where $k=2$ the Acceptance probability $A_{j\xleftarrow{}i}$ is below or above your random threshold then $i$ and $i+k$ will not be independent.
