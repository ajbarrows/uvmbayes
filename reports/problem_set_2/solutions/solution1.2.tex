The number of evaluations of the posterior distribution is determined from the number of parameters which that the posterior distribution depends on, and their sampling. In this case, the posterior distribution depends on parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\sigma$, and each parameter uses a sampling resolution of 10, so the number of evaluations of the posterior distribution is $n^3=10^3=1000$. We are making the assumption here that the parameters are independent, i.e. their sampling is independent.
